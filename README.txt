1. In part1 of the assignament. (In diagram)  - 

A.I have assumed that the submenus 

				Washing Machines
				Televisions
				Refrigerators
				Air conditioners
				Small home appliances
				Health care appliances
				
comes under electronics and the sub sub menus 

				Sony
				Samsung
				LG
				Hisense
			
comes under television. 

Reason :: Even though the submenus falls under appliances I assumed since the sub sub category highlighted in yellow is shown for television.

2. Regarding implementation of WebSocket server to serve the data dynamically to the HTML5/JS application, 


   2.1 For this I have created a dynamic web project in Eclipse IDE.
   2.2 
   
   All the HTML,JS, and CSS file is same as implementation done in Step 1.
   Only difference is it is created as dynamic web application in spring.
   Inorder to run the application either run in Server (Tomcat) or JettyServer.
